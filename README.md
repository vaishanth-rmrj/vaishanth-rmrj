## Greeting fellow humans! 
I am Vaishanth Ramaraj, a Graduate student at University of Maryland pursuing Robotics Engineering. I'm a fan of cool algorithms, especially ones that ðŸ”­ involve Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

Here's a sneak peek into my world:

- When I'm not making robots dance to my commands, you can find me deep diving into computer vision and ML projects.
- I'm always on the lookout for the next challenge, so bring it on!
- I believe laughter is the best medicine (unless you have a broken rib, then maybe just rest and ice). So, I try to add a good dose of humor in all my projects.
- Feel free to take a look at my repositories, who knows you might find something you like. And if you want to get in touch, drop me a line at ðŸ“«  vrmrj@umd.edu. You can also connect with me on LinkedIn: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaishanth-ramaraj/"><img height="25" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-0077B5?style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white"></a>

That's all folks!
